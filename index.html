		<h1>Screen Readers in Web Design</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the screen reader web design guide!</p>
		<p>This tutorial and guide aims to educate and provide insight into proper web design that enables screen readers to function properly. This guide includes a tutorial guide, a set of examples of web design that does not follow the proper design choices that assist screen readers for the purpose of making the concepts easier to understand, and a comprehension check to test your knowledge.</p>

					<p>Screen Readers are not only for the blind. Those with low vision, or those who have some visual impairment make up a good deal of users. There is also a small, but not insignificant number who use screen readers for other reasons. Accessability helps even those who were not the primary audience.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md">
					<img src="img/reader.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
					<p>Screen Readers come in all forms. Some are just software, with different readers for different operating systems and features. Hardware screen readers come with extra ways to interact with the reader. You may have a custom keyboard, ergonomic response buttons, or a physical braille reader.</p>

				<div class="col-md">
					<img src="img/order.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
					<p>Screen Readers access content on a page in a certain order, but that order won't be the exact same between two pages. The order that information is presented is as important when using screen readers, as it is without. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md">

					<p>While designing a website for use with screen readers, keep in mind other accessability venues. It is important to remember that accessability has many angles. You don't want to make your website easy to use for a screen reader, but have text that is hard for those without.</p>
